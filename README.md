# Malaria Detection with TensorFlow
This repository contains code for a Malaria detection project using TensorFlow. The project includes data preprocessing, model creation (ResNet), training, evaluation, and deployment scripts.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/1666sApple/Malaria-Detection-Tensorflow.git
cd Malaria-Detection-Tensorflow 
```

## Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.

#### Folder details:
```
`data/`: Directory containing data loading and preprocessing scripts.
`models/`: Directory containing the ResNet model architecture script.
`utils/`: Directory containing utility scripts for image processing and training utilities.
`main.py`: Main script for running the entire pipeline.
`train.py`: Script for training the model.
`evaluate.py`: Script for evaluating the trained model.
`.gitignore`: Ignores specific files.
`requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.
```

## Training
To train the model, run:
```
python train.py
```

This script will train the model using the default parameters and save the trained model in the saved_model/ directory.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model, run:
```
python evaluate.py
```
This script will load the trained model and evaluate its performance on the validation and test datasets.
